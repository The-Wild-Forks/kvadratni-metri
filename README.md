# kvadratni-metri
inspired by Mechochuk

```
take user input for 2 values 
duljina and shirina are the the names of the values and fields
users put the inputs in each field 
then hit submit
store each value in the variables
the 2 values are then taken and 
multiplied with eachother (var duljina x var shirina)
the result is then put in a var called kvadratenm
kvadratenm is displayed to the user in the end
and it triggers a celebration popup alert saying "congratz u are a pediras maznaaa"

```
